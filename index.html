        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Zachariah Keiler-Bradshaw. Formerly immersed in the dynamic world of restaurant service, I've recently embarked on an exhilarating journey into the realm of computer programming.
                
        My transition from the bustling kitchen environment to the intricate world of code may seem unconventional, but it's fueled by a deep passion for exploration and learning. While my previous role honed my ability to thrive in fast-paced settings and deliver exceptional customer experiences, I found myself drawn to the endless possibilities offered by technology.
        
        One of my enduring interests lies in the world of music, particularly the realm of record collecting and obscure punk. Delving into the depths of music history, uncovering rare gems, and immersing myself in the raw energy of punk culture have been constants in my life. This passion for discovery and authenticity mirrors my approach to programming, where I eagerly embrace challenges and seek out unconventional solutions.
        
        As I navigate this exciting new chapter, I'm committed to honing my skills, embracing new perspectives, and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. I'm eager to leverage my diverse background and insatiable curiosity to carve out a meaningful path in the world of computer programming.
        
        Join me as I embark on this thrilling journey of growth, creativity, and innovation.
